C# projects</h3>\n<p>To take advantage of Next.js's <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh\">Fast Refresh</a> support, we're now\nrecommending UI development through its dev server which you can do in rider by opening <code>package.json</code> and running the\n<strong>dev</strong> script:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/ServiceStack/docs/raw/master/docs/images/spa/nextjs-scripts.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/ServiceStack/docs/raw/master/docs/images/spa/vue-vite-run-myapp.png\"\nclass=\"sm:float-right w-72\" style=\"margin: 1rem 0 0 1rem\"></p>\n<p>This launch Next.js in watch mode where any changes to <code>/ui</code> assets will have immediate effect.</p>\n<p>Then to start the back-end C# project, right-click on the Host Project and click <strong>Run</strong> on the projects context menu.</p>\n<p>With both projects started you can open and leave a browser tab running at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>\nwhere it will automatically reload itself at every <code>Ctrl+S</code>.</p>\n<p>When you're ready to preview a development build of the Client UI in your .NET App, run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ npm run build:local\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which will publish your React's App static assets to the .NET App's <code>/wwwroot</code> where it can be previewed from\n<code>https://localhost:5001</code>.</p>\n<h3>Rider's new Task Runner</h3>\n<p>In the latest version of Rider, once you run the npm and dotnet tasks after the first time, they will appear in Rider's\nnew useful task runner widget where you'll be able to easily, stop and rerun all project tasks:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/ServiceStack/docs/raw/master/docs/images/spa/rider-run-widget.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>Start npm &#x26; C# projects from the terminal</h3>\n<p>These GUI tasks are just managing running CLI commands behind-the-scenes, which if you prefer you can use JetBrains\nexcellent multi-terminal support to run <code>$ dotnet watch</code> and <code>$ npm run dev</code> from separate or split Terminal windows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/ServiceStack/docs/raw/master/docs/images/spa/vue-vite-rider-terminals.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>Deploying to Production</h3>\n<p>When you're ready to deploy your App you can create a production build with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ npm run publish\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which will generate production builds of your C# projects and npm projects with its static generated UI assets\nwritten to <code>/wwwroot</code> to be deployed together with your complete .NET App.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation for the best possible responsive UX is to deploy your App's <code>/wwwwroot</code> static assets to a CDN in\norder for the initial load of your App to be downloaded from nearby CDN edge caches.</p>\n<p>To do this configure the production url the UI should use for all its <code>/api</code> Ajax requests by modifying\n<code>DEPLOY_API</code> in your <code>next.config.ts</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">const DEPLOY_API = 'https://$DEPLOY_API'\n</code></pre>\n<p>This template also includes the necessary GitHub Actions to deploy this Apps production static assets to GitHub Pages CDN,\nfor more info, checkout <a href=\"/posts/deploy\">GitHub Actions Deployments</a>.</p>\n<h3>Get Started</h3>\n<p>Driven by the static typing benefits of TypeScript, React bundles full\n<a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/static-type-checking.html#type-definitions\">Type Definitions with their libraries</a>\nthat development IDEs like Rider take full advantage of that's used to power its type-safe &#x26; productive intelli-sense dev UX.</p>\n<p>If you're new to React a good place to start is\n<a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html\">React Getting Started</a>.</p>","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/preview/cover.jpg"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/preview/cover.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
