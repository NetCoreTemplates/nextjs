## App Features

### Stale While Revalidate

[stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/) is a popular UI pattern helps developers balance 
between immediacy—loading cached content right away—and freshness—ensuring updates to the cached content are used in the future.

This template includes a `swrClient` that provides a typed wrapper around [Vercel's SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) 
library for making typed API Requests with ServiceStack's typed 
[JsonServiceClient](https://docs.servicestack.net/typescript-add-servicestack-reference).

```tsx
import { swrClient } from "../lib/gateway"
import { Hello } from "../lib/dtos"

const HelloApi = ({ name }) => {
  const {data, error} = swrClient.get(() => 
    new Hello({ name }))
  if (error) return <div>{error.message}</div>
  return <div>{data?data.result:'loading...'}</div>
}
```

This reactively sets up the UI to handle multiple states:
 - `loading` - displays **loading...** message whilst API request is in transit
 - `data` - when completed, populated with a `HelloResponse` and displayed
 - `error` - when failed, populated with `ResponseStatus` and displayed

The primary UX benefits are realized when re-making an existing request in which a locally-cached *stale* version
is immediately returned and displayed whilst a new API Request is made behind the scenes, which updates the UI when completed.

Ultimately this provides the optimal end-user UX with the UI being immediately updated with *stale* results initially, 
before being re-updated with the latest UI when the new API Request is completed.
